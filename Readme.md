# Pong *(simple version)*
This program is a very simple pong written in Java that uses a 'ActionListener' for creating the game loop.

## Purpose
This Pong is subject to refinement and over time the game play is supposed to get more and more sophisticated.

## Further development
As it stands the game is straight forward and does not work with any randomization of the ball nor does the AI respond to the skill of the player.

## Notes
